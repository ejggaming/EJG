ID,Severity,Category,File,Finding,Suggested Change,Status
REV-001,CRITICAL,Correctness,app/agent/agent.controller.ts,"Controller uses template fields (name/description/type/isDeleted) that don't exist on Agent Prisma model","Replace template field references with actual Agent model fields: userId role commissionRate status isActive hiredAt territoryId supervisorId",OPEN
REV-002,CRITICAL,Correctness,app/bet/bet.controller.ts,"prisma.bet does not exist on PrismaClient — 8 references fail","Check Prisma schema model name (likely 'Bet' or different casing). Verify bet.prisma declares the model correctly and run prisma generate",OPEN
REV-003,CRITICAL,Correctness,app/commission/commission.controller.ts,"prisma.commission does not exist on PrismaClient — 5+ references fail","Check Prisma schema model name in commission.prisma. Verify model declaration and run prisma generate",OPEN
REV-004,CRITICAL,Correctness,"All 16 non-template controllers","All controllers are copy-paste from template.controller.ts without adaptation to their actual Prisma model fields","Each controller must be regenerated or manually updated: create/update input types audit log field refs and softDelete filter must match the actual Prisma model",OPEN
REV-005,HIGH,Correctness,app/*/zod/*.zod.ts (potential),"Zod validation schemas likely also contain template-default fields (name/description/type) that don't match actual models","Audit each zod/<module>.zod.ts and update CreateSchema/UpdateSchema to match Prisma model fields",OPEN
REV-006,MEDIUM,Build Config,package.json,"Lint script references non-existent lib-entry.ts causing ESLint to abort entirely","Remove lib-entry.ts from lint script or create the file",OPEN
REV-007,MEDIUM,Convention,"All controllers","Soft-delete pattern uses isDeleted field but most Prisma models don't have this field","Either add isDeleted to all models that need it or remove the soft-delete filter from controllers that don't support it",OPEN
REV-008,LOW,Convention,"All controllers","All 17 controllers follow identical structure (good) but audit log references template.name when the model may not have a name field","Make audit log descriptions use a field that actually exists on each model (e.g. id as fallback)",OPEN
REV-009,LOW,Naming,index.ts,"Module imports use lowercase (drawschedule juetengdraw) but folder names use camelCase (drawSchedule juetengDraw)","Align import variable names with folder naming convention for consistency",OPEN
